Neutron is building the decentralized economy users were promised. As the first integrated blockchain for DeFi, Neutron combines high-performance, app-specific infrastructure with atomic composability—enabling new financial products, better capital efficiency, and a seamless user experience.

## Finance is Broken

Traditional finance has always been about keeping the best opportunities for insiders. Billions remain unbanked, while the wealthy enjoy better rates, services, and opportunities, exacerbating inequality.

Meanwhile, the blockchain industry is chaotic—chasing hype cycles and developing nonsensical use cases to attract VC funding rather than solving real problems.

DeFi promised a fairer alternative but has failed to deliver:

- **Generalist platforms** lack the performance and purpose-specific infrastructure needed for efficient financial applications.
- **Appchains** abandon composability, have weaker network effects, higher costs, and greater maintenance burdens.

The result is fragmentation, inefficiency, and a poor user experience that fails to compete with traditional finance.

## An Integrated Blockchain for Finance

There is significant work left to do if we want DeFi to provide a compelling alternative to traditional finance. This is only possible with an opinionated blockchain—not trying to be all things to all people, but laser-focused on DeFi.

Neutron is the first blockchain to combine:
- The performance and purpose-specific infrastructure of appchains
- The composability, cost-efficiency, and speed of smart contracts

This unique approach unlocks superior financial applications that are impossible to build elsewhere, optimizing capital efficiency, execution, and UX for users.

## The Neutron Thesis

Financial market participants optimize for three key properties: **execution quality** (getting the best prices), **capital efficiency** (maximizing exposure with less capital), and **user experience**. Delivering optimally on these properties requires an integrated approach that combines highly-performant app-specific infrastructure with atomic composability—exactly what Neutron provides.

## What This Means in Practice

Unlike other networks where applications are isolated in the VM, apps on Neutron can tap directly into the network's bespoke resources. Developers can leverage purpose-built infrastructure that enables superior designs impossible to build elsewhere.

Applications on Neutron benefit from:
- Per-block price oracles without third-party dependencies
- Integrated automation for consistent execution of critical functions
- Trust-minimized cross-chain account control and state queries
- Native market primitives for efficient capital allocation
