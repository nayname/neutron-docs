  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Your Development Environment">
    Install Rust and the WebAssembly target:
    
    ```bash
    # Install Rust
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup default stable
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your First Contract">
    ```bash
    # Generate a CosmWasm project
    cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name my-contract
    cd my-contract
    cargo wasm
    ```
  </Step>

## Unique Features

Neutron offers several unique features that set it apart from other blockchains:

### Interchain Queries (ICQ)
Query data from any IBC-connected blockchain directly from your smart contracts.

### Interchain Transactions (ICTX)
Execute transactions on remote chains via IBC.

### Cron Module
Schedule automated contract executions at specific block intervals.

### Oracle Integration
Access high-frequency price data for various assets.
