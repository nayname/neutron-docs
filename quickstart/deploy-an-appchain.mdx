title: "Deploy an Appchain"
description: "Set up and run your own application-specific blockchain"
---

Deploy your own application-specific blockchain (appchain) connected to the Neutron ecosystem. Appchains provide dedicated infrastructure for your application with customized governance, tokenomics, and features.

## What is an Appchain?

An appchain is a sovereign blockchain designed for a specific application or use case. Benefits include:

- **Dedicated Resources**: No competition for block space or gas fees
- **Custom Governance**: Implement application-specific governance mechanisms
- **Specialized Features**: Add custom modules and functionality
- **Interoperability**: Connect seamlessly with Neutron and other Cosmos chains
- **Scalability**: Scale independently without affecting other applications

## Requirements

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements">
    Ensure your system meets these requirements:
    
    - **CPU**: 16+ cores, â‰¥3.5 GHz base clock
    - **RAM**: 64GB minimum, 128GB recommended
    - **Storage**: 500GB+ NVMe SSD
    - **Network**: 100+ Mbps, stable connection

    <Note>
      Bare metal servers are recommended over cloud VMs for optimal performance.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Technical Prerequisites">
    - Experience with Cosmos SDK and Tendermint
    - Understanding of blockchain consensus mechanisms
    - Familiarity with Go programming language
    - Knowledge of IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Appchain">
    Define your appchain's specifications:
    
    - **Use Case**: What problem does your appchain solve?
    - **Tokenomics**: Native token design and distribution
    - **Governance**: How will decisions be made?
    - **Validators**: Who will secure your network?
    - **Modules**: What custom functionality do you need?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Development Environment">
    ```bash
    # Install Go
    wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    
    # Set up environment
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize Your Chain">
    ```bash
    # Clone the Cosmos SDK template
    git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
    cd cosmos-sdk
    
    # Initialize your chain
    appd init mychain --chain-id mychain-1
    
    # Configure genesis
    appd add-genesis-account $(appd keys show validator -a) 1000000000stake
    appd gentx validator 1000000stake --chain-id mychain-1
    appd collect-gentxs
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure IBC Connections">
    Set up IBC to connect with Neutron:
    
    ```bash
    # Install Hermes relayer
    wget https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases/download/v1.4.1/hermes-v1.4.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    tar -xzf hermes-v1.4.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    
    # Configure relayer
    hermes config auto --output ~/.hermes/config.toml \
      --chain mychain-1 \
      --chain neutron-1
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Your Network">
    ```bash
    # Start your appchain
    appd start --minimum-gas-prices="0.025stake"
    
    # In another terminal, start the relayer
    hermes start
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features to Consider

### Custom Modules

Develop application-specific modules:

- **Custom Transaction Types**: Implement specialized transaction logic
- **State Management**: Define how your application state is stored
- **Business Logic**: Encode your application's rules and processes
- **Integration Points**: Connect with existing Cosmos modules

### Governance System

Design governance appropriate for your use case:

- **Proposal Types**: What can be changed through governance?
- **Voting Mechanisms**: How are decisions made?
- **Stakeholder Participation**: Who can participate in governance?
- **Execution**: How are approved proposals implemented?

### Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Validator Set**: Ensure you have a diverse and reliable validator set to secure your network.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Gradual Rollout**: Consider starting with a small validator set and gradually decentralizing as your network grows.
</Tip>

## Integration with Neutron

Your appchain can leverage Neutron's features:

- **Interchain Queries**: Query Neutron's state from your appchain
- **Interchain Transactions**: Execute transactions on Neutron
- **Shared Security**: Potentially leverage Neutron's security
- **Ecosystem Access**: Connect to Neutron's DeFi ecosystem
