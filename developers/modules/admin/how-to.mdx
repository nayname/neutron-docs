description: "Understanding how the DAO interacts with the admin module"
---

This guide explains how the admin module works within Neutron's governance system. The admin module is exclusively accessible by the DAO through WebAssembly bindings.

<Warning>
The admin module cannot be used directly by individual users or external contracts. All interactions must go through Neutron's DAO governance process.
</Warning>

## Understanding Admin Module Access

The admin module operates under a strict access control model:

- Only the DAO can send messages to the admin module
- Messages are sent using WebAssembly bindings from the Main DAO
- Individual users cannot directly submit proposals or interact with the module

## DAO Governance Process

### Proposal Types

The DAO can submit two types of proposals through the admin module:

#### Legacy Proposals
- Based on the traditional `x/gov` module structure
- Include predefined proposal types like `MigrateContract` or `DeleteAdmin`
- Processed through dedicated handlers
- Must be part of a whitelisted group for execution

#### Message-Based Proposals
- Introduced with SDK 0.47
- Allow execution of any valid `sdk.Msg`
- Provide greater flexibility for governance operations
- Require modules to implement an `authority` field

### Proposal Execution

When the DAO submits a proposal:

1. **Submission**: The DAO creates a proposal using WebAssembly bindings
2. **Validation**: The admin module validates the proposal format and content
3. **Authorization**: The module verifies the sender is the authorized DAO
4. **Execution**: Valid proposals are executed immediately within the message server

## Message Structure

Proposals sent to the admin module follow Cosmos SDK guidelines and contain:

- **Proposal Content**: The specific actions or changes to be implemented
- **Proposer**: The DAO address submitting the proposal
- **Message Type**: Either legacy proposal format or message-based format

## Integration with Neutron Infrastructure

The admin module integrates seamlessly with Neutron's governance infrastructure through:

- **ProposalExecuteMessage Binding**: Allows processing of any Cosmos message type
- **Signer Verification**: Ensures only authorized DAO can submit proposals
- **Immediate Execution**: Proposals execute directly in the message server without queuing
