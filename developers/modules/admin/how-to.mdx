description: "Understanding how the Main DAO interacts with the admin module"
---

This guide explains how the admin module works within Neutron's governance system. Unlike other modules that users can interact with directly, the admin module is exclusively accessible by the **Main DAO contract**.

<Warning>
The admin module cannot be used directly by individual users or external contracts. All interactions must go through Neutron's DAO governance process.
</Warning>

## Understanding Admin Module Access

The admin module operates under a strict access control model:

- **Only the Main DAO contract** can send messages to the admin module
- Messages are sent using WebAssembly bindings from the Main DAO
- Individual users cannot directly submit proposals or interact with the module
- All administrative operations require DAO governance approval

## How It Works

### 1. DAO Governance Process

When the Neutron community wants to execute administrative operations:

1. **Proposal Creation**: Community members create proposals through the DAO interface
2. **Community Voting**: NTRN token holders vote on the proposal
3. **Proposal Execution**: If approved, the Main DAO contract sends messages to the admin module
4. **Admin Module Processing**: The admin module validates and executes the whitelisted operations

### 2. Message Flow

```
Community Proposal → DAO Voting → Main DAO Contract → Admin Module → Network Changes
```

The admin module receives `ProposalExecuteMessage` bindings from the Main DAO contract and processes them according to its whitelisting rules.

## Submitting Proposals to the Main DAO

<Warning>
Neutron does **not** use the standard Cosmos SDK `gov` module for proposals. All governance goes through the Main DAO contract via WASM execution.
</Warning>

### Method 1: Using Governance Interfaces (Recommended)

The easiest way to submit proposals is through web interfaces:

- **[governance.neutron.org](https://governance.neutron.org)** - Official governance interface
- **[daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone)** - Alternative DAO interface

These interfaces handle the complexity of WASM message formatting and provide user-friendly proposal creation workflows.

### Method 2: Direct WASM Execute

For programmatic proposal submission, use WASM execute messages to the Main DAO contract:

```bash
# Execute a propose message on the Main DAO contract
neutrond tx wasm execute neutron1436kxs0w2es6xlqpp9rd35e3d0cjnw4sv8j3a7483sgks29jqwgshlt6zh \
  '{"propose": {"msg": {"propose_single": {"title": "Your Proposal Title", "description": "Your proposal description", "msgs": [/* your admin module messages */]}}}}' \
  --from=<your-key> \
  --chain-id=neutron-1 \
  --gas=auto \
  --gas-adjustment=1.5
```

### Method 3: WASM Submit Proposal (CLI)

Alternative CLI method using the WASM submit-proposal command:

```bash
# Submit proposal via WASM module
neutrond tx wasm submit-proposal proposal.json \
  --from=<your-key> \
  --chain-id=neutron-1 \
  --gas=auto \
  --gas-adjustment=1.5
```

Where `proposal.json` contains the properly formatted WASM proposal for the Main DAO contract.

<Note>
The Main DAO contract address is: `neutron1436kxs0w2es6xlqpp9rd35e3d0cjnw4sv8j3a7483sgks29jqwgshlt6zh`
</Note>

## Supported Operations

The admin module can process two types of proposals:

### Legacy Proposals

Traditional Cosmos SDK governance proposals that are still supported for backward compatibility:

- **Parameter Changes**: Updating module parameters using the legacy params system
- **WASM Proposals**: Contract instantiation, migration, and administration
- **IBC Proposals**: Operations for modules that haven't migrated to SDK 0.47 patterns

### Message-Based Proposals

Modern proposals that can execute any whitelisted `sdk.Msg`:

- **Module Parameter Updates**: Using new-style `MsgUpdateParams` messages
- **Contract Operations**: WASM contract management through direct messages
- **Multi-Module Coordination**: Batch operations across different modules

## Message Types

Based on the old documentation, the admin module supports these message types:

### MsgSubmitProposalLegacy

For backward compatibility with legacy proposal formats:

```go
type MsgSubmitProposalLegacy struct {
    Content  *types.Any  `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=content,proto3" json:"content,omitempty"`
    Proposer string      `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=proposer,proto3" json:"proposer,omitempty"`
}
```

### MsgSubmitProposal  

For modern message-based proposals:

```go
type MsgSubmitProposal struct {
    Messages []types.Any `protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=messages,proto3" json:"messages,omitempty"`
    Proposer string      `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=proposer,proto3" json:"proposer,omitempty"`
}
```

### Admin Management Messages

The module also supports admin management operations:

- **MsgAddAdmin**: Add new admin addresses (if applicable)
- **MsgDeleteAdmin**: Remove admin addresses (if applicable)

<Note>
The specific admin management functionality depends on the current network configuration and may not be actively used in Neutron's current governance model.
</Note>

## Security Features

### Whitelisting

The admin module implements strict whitelisting to ensure only approved operations can be executed:

- Message types must be explicitly whitelisted
- Operations are validated before execution
- Unauthorized message types are rejected

### Authority Verification

The module includes signer verification to ensure that only the authorized Main DAO contract can submit proposals:

- Sender address must match the expected DAO contract address
- Messages are cryptographically verified
- Unauthorized senders are rejected

## Querying the Admin Module

While you cannot submit proposals directly, you can query the admin module's state using standard query commands:

```bash
# Query module parameters (if available)
neutrond query adminmodule params

# Query admins list (if available)
neutrond query adminmodule admins
```

<Note>
The admin module provides query functionality but no transaction commands. All state changes must go through the Main DAO contract.
</Note>

## For DAO Developers

If you're working on DAO governance contracts that need to interact with the admin module, you would use the `ProposalExecuteMessage` binding:

```rust
use neutron_sdk::bindings::msg::NeutronMsg;

// This would be called from within the Main DAO contract
let admin_msg = NeutronMsg::SubmitProposal {
    messages: vec![/* your whitelisted messages */],
};
```

However, this is only relevant if you're developing the core DAO infrastructure itself.

## Understanding the Governance Flow

For regular users and developers, here's how to participate in admin operations:

1. **Community Discussion**: Discuss proposed changes in Neutron forums and Discord
2. **Proposal Creation**: Work with the community to create formal DAO proposals
3. **Voting**: Participate in DAO voting using your NTRN tokens
4. **Implementation**: If approved, the DAO automatically triggers the admin module

## Limitations and Considerations

- **No Direct Access**: Individual users cannot interact with the admin module directly
- **DAO Dependency**: All operations must go through the governance process
- **Whitelisting Constraints**: Only pre-approved message types can be executed
- **Network-Wide Impact**: Admin operations affect the entire network

This architecture ensures that critical network operations maintain democratic oversight while providing the technical capability for complex administrative tasks.
