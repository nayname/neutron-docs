The Fee Burner module is a core component of Neutron's tokenomics design. It manages transaction fees by implementing a deflationary mechanism that burns NTRN tokens and redistributes other token denominations to the Treasury.

**Governance-Controlled Parameters**: The Fee Burner module's parameters (such as treasury address) can only be updated through governance proposals. Individual users cannot directly modify module settings.

## Key Features

- **NTRN Token Burning**: Automatically burns all fees collected in NTRN tokens, creating deflationary pressure on the token supply
  
- **Treasury Redistribution**: Directs non-NTRN fee tokens to the Treasury address for ecosystem funding

- **Automatic Execution**: Runs at the end of each block to process accumulated fees

- **Accounting**: Tracks the total amount of NTRN tokens burned over time

## Module Functionality

The Fee Burner module operates through the following workflow:

1. **Fee Processing**: At the end of each block, the Fee Burner module processes all fees in its designated module account:
   - **100% of NTRN tokens are burned**, permanently removing them from circulation
   - Non-NTRN tokens are sent to the Treasury address for further ecosystem management

2. **Record Keeping**: The module maintains a state record of the total amount of NTRN tokens burned since genesis

This mechanism ensures a sustainable tokenomics model by creating continuous deflationary pressure on the NTRN token while providing funding for ecosystem development through the Treasury.
