The Dynamic Fees module provides asset price management functionality that works in cooperation with the fee market module. It maintains a list of asset prices denominated in NTRN tokens to enable dynamic fee calculations and conversions.

<Info>
**Governance-Controlled Parameters**: The Dynamic Fees module's parameters (asset prices) can only be updated through governance proposals. Individual users cannot directly modify module settings.
</Info>

## Key Features

- **Asset Price Management**: Maintains a registry of asset prices denominated in NTRN tokens

- **Fee Market Integration**: Works cooperatively with the fee market module to enable dynamic fee calculations

- **Price Conversion**: Provides data source for converting gas prices from the fee market's base denomination (untrn) into various assets

- **Governance Control**: All price updates require governance approval to ensure network stability

## Module Functionality

The Dynamic Fees module operates through the following workflow:

1. **Price Registry**: Maintains a list of asset prices (ntrn_prices) that represents the value of various tokens relative to NTRN

2. **Fee Market Cooperation**: The fee market module uses these prices as a data source for dynamic fee calculations

3. **Price Conversion**: Enables conversion of gas prices from the base denomination (untrn) into other supported assets

4. **Governance Updates**: Price updates are managed through governance proposals to ensure community consensus

## Parameters

The module maintains the following parameters:

### NTRN Prices

```protobuf
message Params {
  // List of asset prices by the NTRN
  // it's used in cooperation with feemarket module
  // ntrn_prices is a data source to convert gas_price from feemarket's base_denom (untrn)
  // into a given asset
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.DecCoin ntrn_prices = 1;
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ntrn_prices` | []DecCoin | List of asset prices denominated in NTRN tokens |

## Integration with Fee Market

The Dynamic Fees module is designed to work alongside Neutron's fee market implementation:

- **Base Denomination**: The fee market uses `untrn` as its base denomination
- **Price Source**: Dynamic Fees provides the price data needed for conversions
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Enables fee payments in various supported assets
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Supports real-time price adjustments through governance

## Use Cases

### For Network Operators
- **Fee Optimization**: Enables more flexible fee structures
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Allows users to pay fees in different tokens
- **Price Stability**: Provides mechanism for maintaining stable fee costs

### For Users
- **Payment Flexibility**: Option to pay fees in various supported assets
- **Predictable Costs**: More stable fee calculations based on asset prices
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear price ratios for different assets

### For Governance
- **Price Control**: Community control over asset price ratios
- **Network Tuning**: Ability to adjust pricing for network optimization
- **Economic Policy**: Implementation of tokenomics through price management

This module is essential for Neutron's advanced fee market functionality, enabling sophisticated fee structures while maintaining community governance over critical pricing parameters.
