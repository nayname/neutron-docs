---

The IBC Rate Limit module provides rate limiting capabilities for IBC transfers by delegating logic to a CosmWasm contract.

<Warning>
**CLI Implementation Issue**: The current CLI implementation has a bug that prevents query commands from working. Use REST endpoints instead.
</Warning>

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | string | Address of the CosmWasm contract implementing rate limiting logic |

## Queries

### QueryParams
Retrieve the current module parameters.

**REST:**
```
GET /neutron/ibc-rate-limit/v1beta1/params
```

**Response:**
- `params`: Current IBC Rate Limit parameters

## Messages

### MsgUpdateParams
Update module parameters through governance.

**Authority Required**: Governance only

**Fields:**
- `authority`: Governance authority address
- `params`: New module parameters

## Events

### EventBadRevert
Emitted when there's an error during packet revert operations.

**Type:** `bad_revert`

**Attributes:**
- `module`: Module name (`rate-limited-ibc`)
- `failure_type`: Type of failure encountered (`acknowledgment` or `timeout`)
- `packet`: The IBC packet data
- `acknowledgement`: The acknowledgement data (only present for acknowledgment failures)

## Key Concepts

- **Contract-Based**: Rate limiting logic is implemented in a CosmWasm contract
- **IBC Middleware**: Intercepts IBC packets to apply rate limits
- **Automatic Processing**: Rate limits are checked automatically during IBC transfers
- **Query-Only**: Users can only query the contract address parameter
- **Governance Updates**: Parameters can only be updated through governance proposals

## Contract Integration

<Warning>
**Contract-Specific Messages**: The following messages are examples based on typical rate limiting contract implementations. The actual messages depend on the specific contract deployed. Only the core module messages (`send_packet`, `recv_packet`, `undo_send`) are standardized by the Go module.
</Warning>

The module communicates with a CosmWasm contract that handles:
- **Path Quotas**: Rate limits for specific channel/denom combinations
- **Flow Direction**: Separate limits for inbound and outbound transfers
- **Time Windows**: Configurable quota periods
- **Percentage Limits**: Limits based on percentage of total token supply

### Core Contract Messages (Standardized)

The module sends the following standardized messages to the rate limiting contract:

**send_packet**: Sent when an IBC packet is being transmitted from Neutron
```json
{
  "send_packet": {
    "packet": {
      "sequence": 1,
      "source_port": "transfer",
      "source_channel": "channel-0",
      "destination_port": "transfer", 
      "destination_channel": "channel-0",
      "data": {
        "denom": "untrn",
        "amount": "1000000",
        "sender": "neutron1...",
        "receiver": "cosmos1..."
      },
      "timeout_height": {},
      "timeout_timestamp": 0
    }
  }
}
```

**recv_packet**: Sent when an IBC packet is being received by Neutron  
```json
{
  "recv_packet": {
    "packet": {
      // Same structure as send_packet
    }
  }
}
```

**undo_send**: Sent when a packet send fails and needs to be reverted
```json
{
  "undo_send": {
    "packet": {
      // Same structure as send_packet  
    }
  }
}
```
