This document provides a technical explanation of the Cron module architecture, concepts, and design choices.

## What is the Cron Module?

The Cron module enables on-chain time-based automation by maintaining a registry of schedules and executing them at the appropriate block heights. Traditional blockchain applications require external triggers for time-sensitive operations, which creates several challenges:

- **Reliability concerns**: External automation services might fail
- **Centralization risks**: Reliance on third-party services
- **Coordination problems**: Multiple actors might attempt the same operation
- **Timing precision**: Exact execution timing is difficult to ensure

The Cron module solves these problems by moving time-based automation directly onto the blockchain, ensuring deterministic, reliable, and decentralized execution of scheduled operations.

<Warning>
**Governance-Only Access**: The Cron module is governance-gated. Only the Main DAO or Security SubDAO can create, modify, or remove schedules. Individual users and contracts cannot directly interact with this module.
</Warning>

## How does the Cron module work?

The Cron module enables on-chain time-based automation through several components working together:

### Schedule Registration

When a governance proposal creates a schedule, it specifies:
- A unique name for identification
- The execution period (in blocks)
- One or more CosmWasm contract messages to execute
- The execution stage (BEGIN_BLOCKER or END_BLOCKER)

The module stores this schedule in its state and begins executing it according to the specified period.

### Execution Mechanism

The module hooks into Neutron's block production process to check for schedules due for execution:

1. During each block's `BeginBlock` or `EndBlock` phase (depending on the schedule's execution_stage), the module queries for all schedules where:
   ```
   current_block_height â‰¥ (last_execution_height + period)
   ```

2. The module processes up to the configured `limit` of schedules per block to prevent resource exhaustion.

3. For each schedule that meets the execution condition:
   - The module constructs `wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract` messages from the stored schedule data
   - Sets the sender as the Cron module account
   - Sets funds to empty (no tokens are sent)
   - Executes the messages using the WASM message server
   - Updates the schedule's `last_execute_height` to the current block height

4. **Atomicity**: All messages within a single schedule must succeed, or the entire schedule execution is rolled back.

### Schedule Structure

A schedule is the core data structure in the Cron module:

```protobuf
message Schedule {
  string name = 1;                           // Unique identifier
  uint64 period = 2;                         // Blocks between executions  
  repeated MsgExecuteContract msgs = 3;      // Messages to execute
  uint64 last_execute_height = 4;           // Last execution block height
}

message MsgExecuteContract {
  string contract = 1;                       // Contract address
  string msg = 2;                           // JSON-encoded message
}
```

### Execution Stages

The Cron module supports two execution stages:

1. **BEGIN_BLOCKER**: Schedules are executed at the beginning of the block, before any transactions. This is useful for operations that need to happen before other transactions in the block.

2. **END_BLOCKER**: Schedules are executed at the end of the block, after all transactions. This is useful for operations that should occur after all other transactions in the block have been processed.

The choice of execution stage is important for dependencies between operations. For example, if a scheduled operation depends on the state resulting from regular transactions, it should use the END_BLOCKER stage.

### Governance-Based Management

Schedules can only be managed through governance mechanisms:

- **Main DAO**: Can create and remove any schedule
- **Security SubDAO**: Can remove schedules (emergency situations)
- **Individual users/contracts**: Cannot directly interact with the module

This governance-gated approach ensures that critical automated processes cannot be tampered with by unauthorized parties and maintains the security and integrity of the network.

## Security Model

The Cron module implements several mechanisms to ensure security and prevent abuse:

### Execution Limits

To prevent DoS attacks and excessive resource consumption:
- There's a network-wide `limit` parameter (default: configurable) that restricts the number of schedules processed in a single block
- If more schedules are due than the limit allows, some are delayed until subsequent blocks
- Schedules are processed in deterministic order (by last execution height, then alphabetically by name)

### Message Validation

The module validates messages before execution:
- Messages must be properly formatted JSON for CosmWasm contracts
- Invalid messages are rejected during schedule creation
- Execution failures are logged but don't stop other schedules from executing

### Protected State Access

The module's state can only be modified through governance:
- Direct state manipulation is not possible
- All state changes follow proper authorization checks
- Only governance proposals can manage schedules

## Design Decisions

### Why use block heights instead of timestamps?

Block heights provide several advantages over timestamps for scheduling:

1. **Determinism**: Block heights advance in a predictable manner, while block times can vary
2. **Simplicity**: Working with integer increments is simpler than datetime calculations
3. **Consensus**: All validators agree on the current block height without ambiguity

However, this approach means that schedules are sensitive to changes in average block time. If block times slow down or speed up significantly, the real-world timing of scheduled executions will be affected.

### Why allow multiple messages per schedule?

Supporting multiple messages in a single schedule enables more complex workflows:

1. **Atomicity**: Related operations can be grouped together and either all succeed or all fail
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of separate schedules needed
3. **Sequence**: Actions can be executed in a specific order within the same block

This approach simplifies common patterns like "update state, then transfer funds" or "check condition, then execute action."

### Why have different execution stages?

Having both BEGIN_BLOCKER and END_BLOCKER execution stages provides flexibility for different types of automated tasks:

1. **State Preparation**: BEGIN_BLOCKER allows setting up state before any transactions in the block
2. **Post-Processing**: END_BLOCKER enables operations that should occur after all transactions
3. **Dependency Management**: Different stages help manage dependencies between automated operations

This design allows for more complex automation workflows that respect the natural ordering of blockchain operations.

### Why governance-gate the module?

The governance-only access pattern serves several important purposes:

1. **Security**: Prevents malicious actors from creating disruptive schedules
2. **Resource Management**: Ensures only necessary automation is added to the network
3. **Quality Control**: Community review process for all automated tasks
4. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility for scheduled operations

## Implementation Considerations

### Schedule Execution Order

When multiple schedules are due for execution in the same block, they are processed in a deterministic order:
1. First by `last_execution_height` (schedules that haven't run in longer get priority)
2. Then by name (alphabetical order for ties)

This ordering ensures fairness and prevents starvation of schedules.

### Failure Handling

If a scheduled message fails during execution:
1. The entire schedule's execution is rolled back (atomicity)
2. The failure is logged with details
3. The schedule's `last_execution_height` is still updated to prevent retry loops
4. The schedule continues to be processed in future blocks if it's periodic

This approach ensures that temporary failures don't permanently break scheduling logic while maintaining transaction atomicity.

### Message Construction

When executing schedules, the module constructs `wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract` messages:

```go
msg := wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract{
    Sender:   cronModuleAccount,  // Cron module account
    Contract: scheduleMsg.Contract, // From schedule definition
    Msg:      scheduleMsg.Msg,     // From schedule definition  
    Funds:    sdk.Coins{},        // Always empty
}
```

## Module Parameters

Network-wide parameters that can be adjusted through governance:

| Parameter | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `security_address` | Address authorized to remove schedules | Emergency schedule removal |
| `limit` | Maximum schedules executed per block | Resource management and DoS prevention |

## Metrics and Monitoring

The Cron module collects several metrics for monitoring and observability:

- **`execute_ready_schedules`** (histogram): Time taken to execute all ready schedules in EndBlocker
- **`schedule_count`** (gauge): Current number of active schedules
- **`schedule_executions_count`** (counter): Total schedule executions, labeled by success/failure and schedule name

These metrics help operators monitor the health and performance of the Cron module.

## Best Practices for Integration

### Error Handling

Since schedules might fail for various reasons, contracts should:
- Make scheduled operations idempotent (safe to execute multiple times)
- Include validation within scheduled messages
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Design messages to be robust against temporary failures

### Schedule Organization

For complex applications:
- Use descriptive, consistent naming schemes for schedules
- Create separate schedules for independent operations
- Consider execution stages carefully to manage dependencies
- Group related operations into single schedules for atomicity

## Typical Use Cases

The Cron module supports a wide range of time-based tasks:

### Financial Operations

- **Interest accrual**: Regular updates to lending/borrowing rates
- **Vesting schedules**: Gradual token unlocking over time
- **Reward distribution**: Periodic rewards to stakers or liquidity providers
- **Fee collection**: Regular harvesting of accumulated fees

### Protocol Maintenance

- **State cleanup**: Removing expired or obsolete data
- **Parameter updates**: Scheduled changes to protocol parameters
- **Rebalancing**: Periodic adjustments to maintain target ratios
- **Health checks**: Regular validation of system state

### Time-Sensitive Events

- **Auction endings**: Automatic settlement at deadline
- **Governance execution**: Implementing approved proposals after timelock
- **Emergency procedures**: Scheduled failsafes or circuit breakers
- **Market operations**: Regular price updates or arbitrage opportunities

All of these use cases require governance approval to implement, ensuring that only legitimate and beneficial automation is added to the network.
