## Current Status

The Cron module is functioning as designed with no known critical bugs at this time.

## Design Limitations

### Block Time Sensitivity

The Cron module's execution timing is based on block heights rather than precise timestamps. This means:

- If average block time changes significantly, the real-world timing of scheduled executions will be affected
- Schedules are not guaranteed to execute at exact time intervals
- Network congestion or validator issues can delay executions

### Execution Order

The order in which schedules are executed within a block is not deterministic and depends on the underlying storage implementation. Applications should not rely on specific execution ordering.

### Resource Limits

The module has a configurable limit on the number of schedules that can be executed per block. If many schedules are due simultaneously, some may be delayed to subsequent blocks.
