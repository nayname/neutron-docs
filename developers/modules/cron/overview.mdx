This document explains the `cron` module for the Neutron network.

The Cron module allows scheduling automatic smart contract executions at predefined block intervals, similar to Unix cron jobs. This feature enables time-based automation in blockchain applications through governance-controlled schedule management.

## Concepts

The Cron module serves as an on-chain block-based scheduling system that enables:

- **Scheduled Block Executions**: Register messages to be executed at specific block intervals
- **Periodic Tasks**: Set up recurring executions every N blocks
- **Governance-Controlled Scheduling**: All schedule creation requires governance approval

#### Governance-Gated Access

- Schedule creation is controlled through governance (Main DAO or Cron SubDAO)
- Contracts cannot directly create schedules
- Schedule management requires governance proposals

<Info>
The Cron module operates within Neutron's [modular governance system](/concepts/modular-governance), which uses specialized subDAOs to handle different aspects of network management. The Cron SubDAO specifically manages scheduling-related proposals.

#### Block-Based Execution

- Execution timing is based on block heights, not precise timestamps
- The module has a limit on how many schedules can be executed per block
- Schedules are identified by unique names for easy management

## Operation Flow

A typical workflow using the Cron module consists of:

1. **Governance Proposal**: Submit a governance proposal to create a schedule specifying:
   - A unique name
   - The execution period (in blocks)
   - Messages to execute

2. **Schedule Tracking**: The module maintains a registry of all schedules and tracks their execution status.

3. **Automatic Execution**: When a block is produced, the module:
   - Identifies schedules due for execution
   - Executes up to the per-block limit of schedules
   - Updates their last execution height

4. **Schedule Management**: Through governance, schedules can be:
   - Removed when they're no longer needed

## Integration with Smart Contracts

The Cron module integrates with smart contracts through:

- **Execution Callbacks**: The scheduled messages are sent to target contracts
- **Governance Proposals**: Contract owners work with governance to create schedules

This allows developers to implement various block-based functionalities such as:

- Regular protocol maintenance operations
- Periodic distribution schedules
- Block-based DeFi operations
- Automated governance actions
