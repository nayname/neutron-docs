The Transfer module in Neutron is an enhanced wrapper around the standard IBC Transfer module that facilitates token transfers between IBC-connected blockchains. It extends the core functionality with contract detection and callback features to improve interchain token transfer reliability for smart contracts.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Contract Detection" icon="search">
    Automatically detects if the sender is a smart contract using HasContractInfo() to apply contract-specific handling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enhanced Responses" icon="circle-info">
    Provides tracking information with sequence IDs and channel information to help correlate transfers with their results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sudo Callbacks" icon="reply">
    Calls back to sending contracts via Sudo mechanism when acknowledgements or timeouts are received.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IBC Compatibility" icon="link">
    Maintains full compatibility with standard IBC Transfer functionality while adding smart contract enhancements.
  </Card>

## Module Interactions

The Transfer module integrates with other Neutron modules:

- **IBC Core**: Routes packets between chains using the IBC protocol
- **Contract Manager**: Uses `PrepareSudoCallbackMessage()` for callback message preparation
- **Fee Refunder**: Uses fee locking (`LockFees()`) and distribution functions for packet processing

```

The Transfer module wraps the standard IBC transfer functionality, adding contract detection and callback mechanisms for smart contract integration.

## Standard IBC Transfer Features

The module maintains all capabilities of the standard IBC Transfer module:

- Transfer of tokens between IBC-connected chains
- Denomination trace for cross-chain tokens
- Automatic escrowing and releasing of tokens
- Support for transfer timeout and recovery
- Standard queries delegated to underlying IBC transfer implementation

For core IBC Transfer functionality, see the [IBC Transfer documentation](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/apps/transfer/overview.html).
