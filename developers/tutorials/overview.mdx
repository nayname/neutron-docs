Welcome to Neutron's developer tutorials! This section contains guided, step-by-step instructions to help you learn how to build applications on Neutron. Our tutorials focus on Neutron's unique integrated architecture and how to leverage its native modules for cross-chain development.

## Learning Path

We recommend following our tutorials in this order for new developers:

### 1. Foundation
- [Onboarding Tutorial Overview](/developers/tutorials/onboarding/overview) - Complete setup guide and development environment
- [Introduction to CosmWasm](/developers/tutorials/introduction_to_cosmwasm) - Learn smart contract development basics on Neutron

### 2. Development Environment Setup
- [Cosmopark Tutorial](/developers/tutorials/onboarding/cosmopark) - Set up local multi-chain environment for testing

### 3. Get Familiar with Neutron's Integrated Architecture

Before diving into cross-chain development, understand Neutron's native modules that provide unique capabilities:

- **[Cron Module](/developers/modules/cron/overview)** - Schedule automated contract executions on-chain without external bots
- **[Oracle](/validators/oracle-setup)** - Learn about Neutron's high-frequency price oracle that provides reliable price data

These modules work together with Neutron's cross-chain capabilities to create a complete integrated development environment.

### 4. Advanced Cross-Chain Development
- [Interchain Queries (ICQ)](/developers/tutorials/cosmwasm_icq) - Query data from other blockchains trustlessly
- [Interchain Accounts (ICA)](/developers/tutorials/cosmwasm_ica) - Control accounts and execute transactions on remote chains

Building with ICQ and ICA together with cron and oracle represents Neutron's core value proposition: **integrated cross-chain development** where your smart contracts can seamlessly interact with other blockchains without bridges or external infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the tutorials, make sure you have:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.69.0 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for contract optimization and Cosmopark)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.20 or higher, for Cosmopark setup)
- Basic knowledge of blockchain concepts

## Development Setup

For the full development experience, we recommend setting up Cosmopark, which provides a complete local environment with Neutron, Gaia, and IBC relayers:

```bash
# See the Onboarding Tutorial for complete setup instructions
git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests.git
cd neutron-integration-tests/setup
make start-cosmopark
```

## Tutorial Structure

Our tutorials are organized into several categories:

- **Onboarding**: Complete setup and introduction for new developers
- **Core Tutorials**: Focus on Neutron's unique cross-chain capabilities
- **3rd Party Tools**: Integration guides for external development tools
- **Integration Tests**: Advanced testing strategies for your applications
- **Indexers**: Building data infrastructure for your applications
